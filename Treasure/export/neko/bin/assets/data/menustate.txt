You inherited your grandpa's house. 
Somewhere in the garden he hid his secret treasure. 
He left a note directing where to search for it.
Sadly, he was very old when he wrote it, so the information is not very precise.
Do your best to find your grandpa's heirlooms and buy yourself an even bigger house!
